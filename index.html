					<p>Cinema is considered contemporary art, as it joined the rest of the other arts at the end of
						the
						nineteenth century, and it was considered also an expressive art. The moving image is one of
						its
						first tools, and then the sound followed it. Cinema began in the beginning as a mere "game",
						but
						some considered it nothing more than mere entertainment, the noise of which will fade after
						a
						short time. However, cinema reflected the look of the pessimists, as it made its way and
						became
						the eye of the artist that watched and excited. As time passes on, its functions multiplied
						and
						transformed from mere entertainment to a more mature art, thus acquiring a language of its
						own,
						derived from the diversity of its various topics in different schools, the complexity of its
						concepts, and the questions it raises about its identity and affiliations to different
						peoples
						in its intellectual and cultural ideology.</p>

					<p> Over the following century, only seven Arab states established a significant or burgeoning film
						production activity. During this period Egypt, the cultural center of the Arab world, produced
						almost 75 percent of the total output of films in the region as well as comprising the largest
						share of the Arab film market. Eventually, Cairo became—and in many respects remains—the
						region's main center for film studios, artists, training facilities, technical support and
						expertise, and distribution networks. However, since the 1950s (and particularly since the
						mid-1980s) filmmaking activity in Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian community, Tunisia, Morocco,
						and Algeria, as well as in Arab immigrant centers, has led to an increasingly heterogeneous and
						progressively more interactive Arab film culture.</p>

					<p>Before considering Arab cinema itself, it is useful to note a critical dynamic that has
						consistently marred Arab people's relationship with film: their image in Western cinemas. Many
						Arabs and Arab filmmakers view the portrayal of the Arab world in the West as a major obstacle
						to screening, publicizing, and appreciating a fundamentally vibrant Arab film culture. Vilifying
						and stereotyping Arabs has been standard practice since the early years of cinema. Hollywood in
						particular has played a consistent role in spreading images that inculcate racist attitudes
						toward Arabs. <br>
						Since 1896, Hollywood filmmakers have categorized "the Arab" as the enemy. In The Sheik Steps
						Out
						(1937), the American heroine says: "All of them [Arabs] are alike for me." In Hollywood films
						the image of the Arab is all too familiar: dark-skinned men with large noses and black beards,
						wearing kuffiehs (headscarves) and dark sunglasses, and in the background a limousine, women in
						a harem, oil wells, and camels. A variation on this stereotype is the man with gun in hand and
						hatred in his eyes uttering "Allah" or incomprehensible words. Arab women are mostly silent and
						ugly, or beautiful belly dancers and slaves who are often vindictive.</p>

					<p> In hundreds of Hollywood films, Arabs are the bad guys, and the good guys are out to eliminate
						them. For example, Emory Johnson in The Gift Girl (1917), Gary Cooper in Beau Sabreur (1928).
						Long before September 11, 2001, Hollywood Arabs have been invading America and killing its
						innocents. From The Golden Hands of Kurigal (1949) to The Terror Squad(1987) to The Siege
						(1998), the theme of the looming Arab threat to America persists. <br><br>

						The extent to which this stereotypical image of Arabs and the Arab world has influenced Western
						attitudes toward Arab cinema itself, even among film scholars, is a subject for further
						discussion. At a minimum, Arab cinema continues to be largely relegated to the margins of
						English-language film studies; whatever scholarly work on Arab cinema does exist is
						disproportionate to this cinema's influence in the Arab world itself and in major areas of
						Africa and East Asia. Yet, since the 1990s, Western interest in films originating in Arab
						countries has increased. More than ever before, Arab films are making the rounds of film
						festivals and repertory or art cinemas in Europe and North America.
