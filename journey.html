                    <p>It is well known that Egypt is the largest film producer in the Middle East. Egypt's
                        history of
                        films began a few months after the" Lumiere Brothers "was shown in Europe. In 1896,
                        their film
                        was transferred to Egypt and showed exclusively to a group of Egyptians.<br>

                        Egypt was one of the few countries in the Arab world and the Middle East that
                        managed to
                        establish a film industry during its colonization. However, the types of films shot
                        in Egypt at
                        that time were more documentary, similar to cinema or news films.<br>

                        Also, Egypt made more news releases and also started making short films, "from 1927
                        to 1930 two
                        full films were produced per year, five films were released in 1931 and six films
                        each in 1933
                        and 1934". </p>
                    <p>Although all of these films were created independently, in 1935 Studio (مصر) was
                        established and
                        followed by six other studios from 1936 to 1984. Egypt was the most powerful Arab
                        and Middle
                        Eastern country to produce films, which many other countries in the Middle East were
                        looking
                        forward to being like it.<br>

                        Over time, many changes took place that prompted many Egyptian filmmakers to
                        gradually start
                        producing their films in Lebanon. First, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 made it
                        less
                        politically stable in Egypt. Second, the nationalization of the film industry (1962)
                        in Egypt
                        led to more restrictions on films slowly being imposed until the film censorship
                        laws issued in
                        1976.<br><br>

                        Although the Egyptian film industry is not as strong as it was before due to the
                        growing
                        financial problems, it still dominates Arab cinema output, especially in the
                        mainstream cinema,
                        where it produces up to 77% of the films. This is because there is already a system
                        in place for
                        Egyptian cinema which saw its rise in the 1960s.</p>

                    <p>Cinema appeared in Lebanon in the early 1960s, starting with the first Lebanese film "The
                        Adventures of Elias Mabrouk", which is a silent comedy film about a Lebanese immigrant who
                        returns from America to his homeland.<br><br>

                        From the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s (the beginning of the Lebanese civil war), filmmakers and
                        workers in the Egyptian cinema industry, fleeing the contracts imposed on their work from
                        transferring cinema from the private sector to the public sector (nationalization) and helped
                        Lebanon establish a center for investment and activity in film production, ــ in addition to the
                        fact that there were already two studios, Al-Arz and Harounــ, and there was another production
                        company "George Nasser Films" that produced films that were shown on a large scale, such as: To
                        Where? (الى اين؟) the little stranger (الغريب الصغير).<br><br>

                        In the mid-1960s, huge sums of money were invested in the Lebanese cinema industry and the
                        establishment of studios with high-quality equipment such as "sound near east", "Baalbek", and
                        the establishment of a film training institute at the university level at Saint Joseph
                        University in Beirut, following the example of Egypt.<br>

                        It is controversial that the period of the Lebanese Civil War is the most important period in
                        the history of Lebanese cinema. It was during this period that the famous and widely acclaimed
                        films of the 1970s and 1980s were produced by documentaries.</p>

                    <p>In 1928, the first Syrian feature film (The Innocent Victim) was produced based on real events,
                        and despite its commercial success, the Syrian film industry began to diminish due to the huge
                        diversification of Egyptian production.<br><br>

                        After its establishment in 1958, the Ministry of Culture and Guidance was interested in
                        establishing a cinema department with the aim of spreading cinematic culture, establishing a
                        film library and producing cinematic films, and the Ministry contracted with Syrian and foreign
                        experts who produced a large number of short films about Syria, its archeology, popular arts,
                        and its economic and social development.<br><br>

                        In 1963, the Syrian General Organization for Cinema began sending a number of young people
                        abroad to learn cinematic art in the most famous film institutes in the world, and these young
                        men returned from their missions to push cinematic art in their countries forward to start a new
                        cinematic art that differs from what it was before.<br><br>

                        By the 1970s, Syria was producing many high-quality documentaries and fictional films, as films
                        such as The Knife, The Deceived, and Kafr Qasem, made Damascus the alternative focal point in
                        the Arab film industry, but in the eighties, Syrian cinema became more associated with a
                        specific group of directors such as Samir Zekri, Muhammad Malas, Osama Muhammad.</p>

                    <p>The film “Struggle in Jerash" in 1958, is considered the first actual step on the road to
                        establishing a film industry in Jordan. The film was the result of a personal work of a group of
                        Jordanians aspiring to make Egyptian and Syrian films.<br><br>

                        A contribution to the creation of Jordanian cinema came in 1965 with the establishment of the

                    The first Palestinian film to be made is generally believed to be a documentary on King Ibn Saud of
                    Saudi Arabia's visit in 1935 to Palestine, made by Ibrahim Hassan Sirhan, based in Jaffa. Sirhan
                    followed the King and around Palestine, "from Lod to Jaffa and from Jaffa to Tel Aviv". The result
                    was a silent movie. In 1945 Sirhan established the "Arab Film Company". which was followed by
                    preparations for the next film A Storm at Home. The films themselves were lost in 1948.<br><br>

                    The 1948 Palestinian exodus had a devastating effect on the Palestinian society, including its
                    nascent film industry. It is reported that Sirhan was involved with the production of the first
                    Jordanian feature film, The Struggle in Jarash (1957), second Jordanian feature film, My Homeland,
                    My Love, in 1964.<br><br>

                    After 1967 Palestinian cinema was founded. More than 60 films were made in this period, mostly
                    documentaries. The first film festival dedicated to Palestinian films was held in Baghdad in 1973.
                    Mustafa Abu Ali was one of the early Palestinian film directors, and he helped found the Palestinian
                    Cinema Association in Beirut in 1973.<br><br>

                    The largest archive was run by PLO's Film Foundation/Palestinian Film Unit. In 1982, when the PLO
                    was forced out of Beirut, the archive was in storage. it "disappeared" under circumstances that are
                    still unclear.<br>

                    The 1996 drama/comedy Chronicle of a Disappearance received international critical acclaim. and it
                    became the first Palestinian movie to receive a national release in the United States. In 2008 try

                    <p>Libyan cinema has a mixed history although there is little local production of films in Libya,
                        the first recorded film made in Libya was a French-made 1910 documentary" Les Habants du Desert
                        de Lybie". After independence in 1951, the Kingdom of Libya presented some short films about to

                        The Ministry of News and the Syndicate created a cinema division, touring the country with

                    <p>Before the First World War, cinema did not have a presence in Iraq, and although the first film
                        shown in Iraq was in 1909, no clear cinematic activity arose, as silent foreign films remained
                        available until some merchants built cinemas in Baghdad and cities, and they started importing
                        some of these films from time to time. <br><br>
                        In the 1940s under the rule of King Faisal II of Iraq, a true Iraqi cinema began. The General
                        Authority for Cinema and Theater was established in Iraq in 1959 by the left-leaning national
                        government, where it began producing many documentaries, but with the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq
                        war in the early 1980s, Iraqi cinema stopped.<br><br>
                        Saddam Hussein’s arrival to power in 1979 pushed Iraqi cinema in a slightly different direction.
                        The depletion of national resources from the 1980 Iran-Iraq War nearly halted film production.
                        The few films produced were mainly aimed at glorifying legendary Iraqi history or celebrating
                        Saddam Hussein’s rule. And then after Iraq began the attacks on Kuwait, Iraq's sanctions made
                        filmmaking impossible in the country, despite the fact that a new generation of directors is
                        pulsing.</p>

                    <p>National cinema appeared in the Arb Maghreb - Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria - in the wake of the
                        independence of these countries. In 1946, the French established huge studios in Tunisia and
                        Morocco, and they did so to ensure a cinematic alternative in the Arabic language (with French
                        colonial propaganda) to counter the popularity of Egyptian cinema. Which came out of these
                        studios produced by foreigners. <br>

                        After Algeria gained its independence in 1962, it began to focus its films mainly on topics
                        related to the liberation war, such as the movie Battle of Algeria, which became one of the
                        landmarks in the history of the so-called third cinema. In 1964, Algeria established the
                        National Center for Cinema, where it produced many high-profile films such as Rih al-Aures(ريح
                        الاوراس) by Muhammad Khidr Hamina, Opium and the stick (الافيون والعصا) by Ahmad Rachidi, Wind
                        of the South( ريح الجنوب) by Mohamed Samir Riad, in addition to documentaries and short films.
                        The film Chronique des années de braise "The Chronicle of the Years of Embers" is one of the
                        five feature films made in the mid-1970s by Muhammad Khidr Hamina, which won the Grand Prix at
                        Cannes in 1975.<br>
                        In the early 1980s, Amin Mirbal and Muhammad Bou Ameri, along with many other filmmakers, began
                        to focus on issues of agrarian reform, industrialization, and the status of migrant workers from
                        North Africa in Europe.</p>

                    <p>Cinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of Le
                        chevrier Marocain ("The Moroccan Goatherd") by Louis Lumière in 1897. Between that time and
                        1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area.<br><br>

                        In 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM), the nation's film regulatory body, was
                        established. Studios were also opened in Rabat.<br><br>

                        In 1952, Orson Welles' Othello won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival under the Moroccan
                        flag. However, the Festival's musicians did not play the Moroccan national anthem, as no one in
                        attendance knew what it was. Six years later, Mohammed Ousfour would create the first Moroccan
                        movie, Le fils maudit ("The Damned Son").<br><br>

                        In 1968, the first Mediterranean Film Festival was held in Tangier.This was followed in 1982
                        with the first national festival of cinema, which was held in Rabat. In 2001, the first
                        International Film Festival of Marrakech (FIFM) was also held in Marrakech. </p>

                    <p>In 1919, the first feature-length movie produced in North Africa: Les Cinq gentlemen maudits (The
                        Five Accursed Gentlemen) was filmed in Tunisia. In 1924, Samama-Chikli directed a medium-length
                        film called Ain Al-Ghazal (The Girl from Carthage). The first Tunisian actress was Haydée
                        Chikly, who starred in the short film, Zohra in 1922.<br><br>

                        In 1927, the first Tunisian film distribution company, Tunis-Film, started its activities. After
                        independence, movies were exclusively produced by Société Anonyme Tunisienne de Production et
                        d'Expansion Cinématographique (SATPEC). during the 1980s, private production companies and
                        studios emerged. Major foreign movies were filmed in Tunisia including Roman Polanski's
                        Pirates.<br><br>

                        In 2007, several films were produced, such as Making Of, directed by Nouri Bouzid and Nejib
                        Belkadi's VHS Kahloucha. In 2013, Abdellatif Kechiche was the first-ever Tunisian director to
                        win the Palme D'Or award. On March 21, 2018, the country opened its first City of Culture. As of
                        March 2018, there were 22 screens all across Tunisia.</p>

                    <p>Emirati cinema was able to achieve a real revival that led to an artistic movement on the basis
                        of which local films were produced, and they made their mark by showing them in various film
                        festivals that have deservedly won several awards, In addition to being out of the scope of
                        being described as festivals films, and topping the list of galleries. <br> <br>

                        and with the succession of years, the fact that Abu Dhabi was the strongest catalyst for the
                        emergence of many films in the region in general and the Emirates in particular crystallized, as
                        festivals contributed through their various programs and support to the local film in the

                        Emirati cinema had to be radically transformed, and be at the forefront of the general

                        the interest of critics, media, as well as the public, and the secret of success lies in its
                        makers who decided to present something different to cinema and promote Emirati film.</p>

                    <p>The first attempt to establish a cinema in Bahrain was in 1922, by Bahraini businessman Mahmoud
                        Al Saati, who imported a projector and set up a temporary cinema in a hut on the northern coast
                        of Manama. <br><br>
                        The first official cinema was established by Abdullah Al-Zayed and his partners in Manama in
                        1937. The cinema did not have an air-conditioning or heating system, and it is said that the

                        Bahrain cinema was small because it lacked support from the government and the private sector,
